<h2>Dear Diary, do you know anything about me?</h2>
<p>As of today, I am a 19 year old computer science major. This is my diary site where I get
to share my goals, projects,and progress to the world! Documentation is very important and quite frankly,
 I do dare think my life is very important. Enough to make a website dedicated to myself in an effort to
  mark my existence. Please make yourself at home and browse the chapters of my life made available. I talk
    about my hobbies, how they have inspired me to have my current goals with creating something, what steps
     i am taking to make some progress there, and just things I plain like that inspire me. Thank you!</p>
