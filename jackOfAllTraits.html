        <strong>Drawing and painting.</strong> I drew all the time throughout elementary to highschool. I can do realistic drawings but I perferd cartoon-like drawings instead because my dream was to become an animator. I wanted to make animations on paper and bring my drawings to life like Disney did before they went digital. Eventually, I went digital too and strayed away from traditional drawings. I used india ink and watercolors. Rarely acrylic and havent touched oil yet.

        <strong>Digitally hand-drawn animation.</strong> I used a drawing tablet in my early years then upgraded to an Ipad Pro. I drew all my frame works and cells, made up stories to bring to life, added audio and music, and drew each frame by hand. I remember making a 5 second video and it taking a VERY long time. I'm talking 2-3 days. I learned everything on my own.

        <strong>Ceramics and pottery.</strong> I have always wanted to play with clay and bring things to life in a new and 3D way. I could never afford it, not until my first year at Cerritos College. I had trouble finding the class to enroll in, and when I did I was late, but I enjoyed every second of it. I want to take it again, it was in that class that I learned to make vases and vessels! My favorite creation is this giant strawberry vase. If you set it on the floor it will almost reach your knee. I'm very proud of it.
