    <h1>Jack of All Traits</h1>
    <p>"A jack of all traits is a master of none, but still better than a master of none."<br>When I was younger I used to play The Sims all the time. That game is like a life simulator and you were able to choose the traits of your character. I aspired to have the trait named "Jack of All Traits" in real life, and I've had a profound interest in any hobby I've come across. A Jack of All Traits is someone who does not perfectly master one skill because they dabble in multiple. I talk about some hobbies I've been into down below!</p>

        <strong>Drawing and painting.</strong><br>I've learned to draw on my own and I never took a class so my progress with traditional and now digital art was and has been very very slow. I'm proud of my progress. As a kid I used anything I could in my surroundings to draw. Now, india ink and watercolors are what I prefer traditionally. I dabble in pastels and acrylic but I have yet to touch oil paint. Someday I will! I have transitioned to digital art in my free time now.

        <strong>Digitally hand-drawn animation and 3D modeling.</strong> I used a drawing tablet in my early years then upgraded to an Ipad Pro. I drew all my frame works and cells, made up stories to bring to life, added audio and music, and drew each frame by hand. I remember making a 5 second video and it taking a VERY long time. I'm talking 2-3 days. I learned everything on my own and it was my childhood dream of making my own cartoon show driving me through this harsh learning process. I still dream of this but I dont have the same time I had in high school anymore! Occaisonally, I make a template and write down ideas I have to make a show but it has yet to fall into place. The most I have to show for my work other than 3 second gifs is a 7 second introduction scene to some pilot episode I had in mind over 4 years ago! Oh, I also dove into 3D modeling which is pretty cool too.

        <strong>Ceramics and pottery.</strong> I have always wanted to play with clay and bring things to life in a new and 3D way. I could never afford it, not until my first year at Cerritos College. I had trouble finding the class to enroll in, and when I did I was late, but I enjoyed every second of it! It was in that class that I learned to make vases and vessels. My favorite creation is this giant strawberry vase. If you set it on the floor it will almost reach your knee. I'm very proud of it.
